# A Fast UAV Trajectory Planning Framework in RIS-assisted Communication Systems with Accelerated Learning via Multithreading and Federating

This project presents a novel framework for UAV trajectory planning in RIS-assisted communication systems, leveraging federated learning and multithreading to accelerate the training process. The framework utilizes Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm combined with federated learning to optimize UAV trajectories while considering both communication quality and energy efficiency.

## Environment Setup

This project is developed based on Python 3.10 and PyTorch. To set up the environment, please follow these steps:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment
2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

To run the federated learning framework with best model selection strategy (default):
```bash
python fedsac.py --strategy best_model  
```

To run with traditional federated averaging and custom parameters:
```bash
python fedsac.py --strategy fed_avg --fed_num 8 --fed_round 15 --episode 30
```

## Detailed Information


If our code is helpful to you, please cite the corresponding reference. Additionally, we will release code for accelerated RL training based on the Flower framework in the future:
